      <description>About meCurrently, I am a second year ScM student at Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health where my advisors are Dr. Cynthia L. Sears and Dr. Stephanie Hicks. My interest is in tumorigenic bacteria including their tumorigenic mechanisms, host immune defenses and interactions with other species in our microbiota. My current research focuses on the genetic bases of host-microbe interactions and aims to decode the bacterial communications by experimentally extracting and analyzing single-cell and bulk RNAseq data from colorectal cancer patients and mouse models.</description>
