<h1>About me</h1>
<p>Currently, I am a second year ScM student at Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health where my advisors are <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/cynthia-sears">Dr. Cynthia L. Sears</a> and <a href="https://www.stephaniehicks.com/">Dr. Stephanie Hicks</a>. My interest is in tumorigenic bacteria including their tumorigenic mechanisms, host immune defenses and interactions with other species in our microbiota. My current research focuses on the genetic bases of host-microbe interactions and aims to decode the bacterial communications by experimentally extracting and analyzing single-cell and bulk RNAseq data from colorectal cancer patients and mouse models.</p>
<p>Previously, I received my bachelor of arts in International Affairs and bachelor of science in molecular cellular biology from the George Washington University where I worked in <a href="https://smhs.gwu.edu/zheng-lab/lab-director">Dr. Xiaoyan Zheng’s lab</a> and studied novel tumor suppresors in NSCLC. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6975268/">Paper</a></p>

<h2>Also…</h2>
<p>I am an avid transportation enthusiast since <em>age = 0</em>! I hold a pilot license, a boat license, and driving license of motorcycle and of course, four-wheel cars. My near-term goal is to get a city bus operating endorsement (in China, it’s the A3 permit). I have been a part of the ATC team at <a href="https://www.vatprc.net/en/home">VATSIM PRC Division</a> for 10 years.</p>
